# UPDATE Operations

The UPDATE query is used at National 5 to edit the value(s) stored in one field of a database table. 

For example: 

``` sql linenums="1"
UPDATE Product 
SET price = price * 1.10 
WHERE productName LIKE ‘D*’; 
```

This query will increase the price of every product, with a name that begins with the letter D, by 10%. 

For Higher, candidates are required to use a single query to change the values stored in more than one field of a database query. 

The general syntax of this `UPDATE` query is: 

``` pseudocode linenums="1"
UPDATE tableName 
SET field1 TO expression... , field2 TO expression ...
WHERE criteria ... ; 
```
!!! note "Note"
    Each expression used in the `SET` clause can be a specific value or an expression (which can, if required, use arithmetic operators). The `WHERE` clause is optional.
