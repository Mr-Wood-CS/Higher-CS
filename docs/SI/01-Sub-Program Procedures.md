# Sub-program Procedures

## Modularity

Modularity means that when a program is written it is split up into smaller chunks called sub-programs. Imagine a program with millions of lines of. This would be split up into different programming teams to complete. 

Each of the sub-programs does a specific job. For example one sub-program may be to get user information. Each of the subprograms can be used in any order and can be reused multiple times. 

!!! example
	```Python
	# This is a comment
	# The computer ignores lines that start with this symbol
	```
