# Working with Records

!!! info "What you need to know"

	You must be able to describe, exemplify and implement arrays of records 

## Explanation

In Python, an array of records is like a list of boxes, where each box holds important information about a person, place, or thing. 

Each "box" (record) has labelled parts for details, like a name, age, or ID number. 

For example, if we have three students, we can store their name, age, and registration number in three separate __boxes__.

These boxes are part of a record, and we can easily look inside each one to see or change the details.
