# Parrllel 1D Arrays

## Explanation

You already know that an array is a list of related values, called elements, that can be referred to by number, e.g. temperature[0], temperature[5] etc.

This example below now adds a second array that records the date on which the temperature was taken.

We can look up the temperature on, say, the 8th of June, by looking for that date, and reading the corresponding temperature (14Â°). 

These are parallel arrays, because we can look up corresponding values, like a table.
