<h2 style="text-align:center;">Welcome to SQA Higher Computer Science!</h2>


The SQA National Higher Computer Science course is an exciting program that will help you develop essential skills and knowledge in the world of technology. The course is divided into three main units: Software Design and Development, Computer Systems, and Database Design and Development.

In Software Design and Development, you'll learn how to design, write, and test programs, which will help you solve real-world problems through coding. This is where you start to think like a programmer and use logic to create solutions.

The Computer Systems unit will help you understand how computers work, from the hardware components to the software they run. You‚Äôll explore the physical parts of a computer, such as the CPU and memory, as well as the different ways information is stored and processed.

Finally, in Database Design and Development, you‚Äôll learn to design and manage databases, which are used everywhere to organize and retrieve information. This unit will give you the skills to handle data efficiently and understand how information is managed in real-world applications.

Each unit will build your skills, preparing you for further study or careers in technology, software development, cybersecurity, and many other fields.
